An Java interface to the Global Data Plane.
<p>"The Global Data Plane provides a data-centric glue for swarm applications.  The basic primitive is that of a multi-input, multi-output, time-aware secure log.  Data inputs are timestamped and rearranged by timestamp. Data can be securely commited to the log in a variety of ways, including via a external consistent transactional model.  Data within the log can be randomly read, thereby permitting a variety of data models, including (eventually) a SQL query model.  Further, data within a log can be preserved for the long term."

<p>As of October, 2014, the GDP was not yet released.  See
<a href="http://www.terraswarm.org/swarmos/wiki/Main/GDPJavaInterface#in_browser" target="_top">GDP Java Interface</a> in the TerraSwarm wiki, which is only accessible by people associated with TerraSwarm.</p>

<p>This package consists of a Java interface to the GDP.</p>

<p>Most of the java files were created using JNAerator.</p>

<p>The file GdpUtilities.java contains utilities that were written by hand.  These utilities are useful for dealing with the return values of the GDP, which are unsigned longs and thus difficult to use with Java before JDK 1.8.</p>

<p>The <code>apps/</code> directory contains GDP applications ported from the c-based <code>gdp/apps/</code> directory.
