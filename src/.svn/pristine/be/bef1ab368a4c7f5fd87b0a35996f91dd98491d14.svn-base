Installation and deployment of CERTI

Requirements: we assume that you have a
- recent C++ compiler 
- the CMake tool
- Bison, the GNU version of yacc.
###################################
1) Installation process (summary):

	1.	Get the last CERTI cvs source using the command: 
	
	      cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/sources/certi co certi
	      
	      Note: 2014-12-20, the CVS head was broken,
	      see https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?40977
	      
	      Instead, try:
	      wget http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/certi/CERTI-3.4.3-Source.tar.gz
              tar -zxf CERTI-3.4.3-Source.tar.gz 

	2.	Go to the CERTI cvs folder downloaded
	           cd CERTI-3.4.3-Source
	3.	Create the folder 'build_certi' and go to this folder
	           mkdir build_certi
		   cd build_certi
   	4.	Run cmake:
	           cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path_for_scripts_and_binaries> -DCERTI_USE_NULL_PRIME_MESSAGE_PROTOCOL=ON ../
                For example:
                   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/certi-3.4.3 -DCERTI_USE_NULL_PRIME_MESSAGE_PROTOCOL=ON ../
		All  files required to build CERTI are stored in the 'build_certi' folder.
	5.	Run:
                   make
	6.	Asr root, run
                   make install

Note: In your current terminal, you'll see  information about the (correct) build 
of CERTI and where are stored the different environment scripts used to set the 
CERTI environment.

2) Deployment

For the deployment of an HLA Federation in C++, you need to launch one terminal for running the 'rtig' binary, and one terminal per federate if you have displayed information. To excute the 'rtig' or a federate do this procedure :

	1.	Open a new terminal
	2.	Source the CERTI environment script. This script is stored in the 
	    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set during the installation process 
	    (see previous subsection).
	3.	'source <path_for_scripts_and_binaries>/share/scripts/myCERTI.sh'
	4.	Run 'rtig' or the federate required, for example './<fed-binary>'

3) Debug information

Environment variables used to display traces (e.g. messages) from CERTI :

- 'export RTIG_MSG=D' in RTIG (for messages exchanged between RTIA <--> RTIG)

- 'export RTIA_MSG=D' in a Federate's terminal (for messages exchanges between Federate <--> RTIA)
