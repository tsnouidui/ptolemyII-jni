Classes for the TerraSwarm Project.

<p>
The TerraSwarm Research Center
(<a href="http://www.terraswarm.org">http://terraswarm.org</a>),
launched on January 15, 2013, is addressing the huge potential (and
associated risks) of pervasive integration of smart, networked sensors
and actuators into our connected world. The center is funded by the
STARnet phase of the Focus Center Research Program (FCRP) administered
by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC). Funding comes from
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the SRC
industry partners, including Applied Materials, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, IBM,
Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Raytheon, Texas Instruments, and
United Technologies. </p>
